## Description

Soccer Scout is a web application that allows users to search for soccer players. Scouts or players can create an account to post a new up and coming player or look for existing players in our extensive database of players. You will be presented with many features about the player to find the right one.
Users are able to add as many players as they want from the Create user section in profile, as well as view the players they have posted in the dashboard section of their Profile. Users are also able to search players by country to find one in their country to recruit. The application uses React, MongoDB, Material UI, GraphQL, and Apollo.
